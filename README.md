# Saving Mr Kick
<p>
  Saving Mr Kick was a game I created during my senior year of high school for AP Computer Science A. This game was created for our final, in which we were instructed to create any programming related project that we desired. I decided to create a 3D dungeon puzzle escape type game in which the player must navigate through a dungeon, solving various types of puzzles along the way to help Mr Kick escape. Unreal Engine was used in order to create this game, which was an extremely fun and rewarding tool to learn. If you would like to play, you may download the game <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l2S33-1E0nlU2vUqkRjtxcnM3eZJ8Sk7?usp=drive_link">here</a>. <br> <br>
<strong>Note: This game was created for and currently only works on Windows machines</strong>
