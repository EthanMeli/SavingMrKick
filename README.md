# Saving Mr Kick
<p>
  Saving Mr Kick was a game I created during my senior year of high school for AP Computer Science A. This game was created for our final, in which we were instructed to create any programming related project that we desired. I decided to create a 3D dungeon puzzle escape type game in which the player must navigate through a dungeon, solving various types of puzzles along the way to help Mr Kick escape. Unreal Engine was used in order to create this game, which was an extremely fun and rewarding tool to learn. All files for the project are found in the BreakFreeApp folder, and all must be installed in order for the game to run properly. <br> <br>
<strong>Note: This game was created for and currently only works on Windows machines</strong>
